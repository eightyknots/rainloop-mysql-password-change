# Rainloop MySQL Password Change Plugin

This is a plugin that allows you to add a custom MySQL password change plugin to your
Rainloop install.

## Developer's Note

Please note that while security is a mission-critical element, this plugin is still
undergoing heavy development. **Do not use this plugin in production.**

## Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

* PHP 5.6 with OpenSSL Extension or PHP 7.0+
* PDO Extension with mysql driver

### Recommended Requirements

* PHP 7 (or with the userland [random_bytes() function](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.random-bytes.php) installed)
* PHP 5.6 with OpenSSL extension

## Installing

1. Clone this repo in the ``plugins`` directory on your Rainloop installation or download the zip and unzip it there.
2. Login to your Rainloop admin panel, and under "Plugins", activate this plugin (**mysql-password-change**).
3. Follow the on-screen setup.

## Customising

There are a number of setup options you should set when enabling this plugin.

* MySQL connection details (hostname, port, username, password)
* MySQL database name
* Table name of accounts
* Username/Email column name (uses Rainloop's account model, ``\RainLoop\Account``)
* Password column name
* Encryption scheme
* Rounds for sha256 or sha512 schemes

### Encryption schemes

Currently the following encryption schemes to hash passwords are supported. They are listed from most recommended to *avoid*.
Please select the one currently in use on your MySQL server.

* ``sha512_crypt``: SHA512 encryption with salt and default rounds set to 5000. **This is the recommended scheme to use.**
* ``sha256_crypt``: SHA256 encryption with salt and default rounds set to 5000.
* ``php``: Uses the built-in PHP ``password_hash()`` with the ``PASSWORD_DEFAULT`` algorithm. Requires PHP 5.5 or greater.
* ``mysql``: Use the built-in MySQL ENCRYPT() function.
* ``sha1``: Use an unsalted sha1 hash.

While ``php`` can be useful, because you're probably using Postfix to verify accounts on the IMAP(S) side, it may not be
the wisest choice as the ``PASSWORD_DEFAULT`` algorithm can change at any time.
